	 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
	 * "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
	 * and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
	 * 
	 * For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the
	 * researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 
	 * 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at
	 * least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3
	 * citations each, his h-index is 3.
	 * 
	 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is
	 * taken as the h-index.
